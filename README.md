I currently lead the Partnership team at Frame.io which includes DevX, Partner Success, and Camera to Cloud partners.
You can find me active on the [frame.io developer forums](https://forum.frame.io) if you have any questions about our platform or c2c APIs.

I come from the filmmaking world initially, building out systems and workflows when I was a Digital Imaging Technician (DIT). I used to write about my experiences on my [blog](https://dorkinatent.com), and you can find my past work [here](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2381085).

I've since honed my passions for photography and cinematography, and I still find time every so often to get behind the lens and work with some of the most talented folks over at Maximum Effort. You can find my portfolio [here](https://charliethedp.com).

I'm a tinkerer and DIYer at heart and so when I can't find a solution to a problem I have I tend to make up the solution myself, hence why I turned to coding. Cursor and Claude Code have expanded my abilities to take ideas and turn them into practical applications.

I take the same approach to coding that I do with filmmaking: fix it in prep. The more info you can provide with as much detail as possible with the problems and audiences clearly defined, the better outcome you will get with AI.

This github is where my thoughts live, some repos are for side projects (also a big gamer), and mostly where I can collaborate with friends who are way more talented than I.

So "stay awhile and listen", and if you'd like to contribute feel free to open a PR.
