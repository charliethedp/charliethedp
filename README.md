**Partnerships & Developer Experience Leader · Former Cinematographer & DIT · Tinkerer**

---

I lead the Partnerships team at Frame.io (Adobe), which spans Developer Experience, Camera to Cloud partner ecosystem, and customer/partner success. Our mission is to make Frame.io the go-to platform for creative production by empowering developers and partners to integrate it everywhere.

Day to day that means building SDK programs, growing technical partner ecosystems across hardware and software, rebuilding developer documentation, and staying close to what developers are actually experiencing — which is why I'm still answering questions in the forums myself.

## How I got here

I spent 15 years as a cinematographer and Digital Imaging Technician (DIT) on film and TV productions — network dramas, commercials, music videos. A DIT sits at the intersection of the camera and post-production, managing on-set data pipelines, color science, and technical workflows under pressure on live sets.

That job made me a coder before I knew that's what I was. I was writing scripts to automate data wrangling, building custom tools to manage footage handoffs, and figuring out how to make complex technical systems work reliably when there was no room for failure. When I moved into developer relations and partnerships, the instinct was the same — understand how things actually work, build the infrastructure that makes them reliable, and help other people get there faster.

The tinkerer instinct never left. It just found a different outlet.

## What I'm building with right now

- **Claude / Opus via Cursor** — SwiftUI projects, learning iOS development from scratch
- **Claude Code** — terminal, Warp, for workflow automation and scripting
- **Xcode** — because SwiftUI seemed hard and that's usually a good reason to start

## What I think about

- What great AI developer experiences actually feel like from the developer side
- The gap between "the API is powerful" and "the developer knows what to build next"
- How responsible AI development shows up in the programs and content we build, not just the policies we write
- Why the best developer relations is indistinguishable from genuine technical community membership
